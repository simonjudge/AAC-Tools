Simply drop your .clkx file ontop of the ExtractMediaFromClicker.exe file. A bunch of sound and image files will then be extracted and saved to the same directory of your clicker file

Caveats: 
- You may need to move the clicker file somewhere writeable - e.g. it may struggle to write to networked drives. 
- If you lose any files don't blame me - to be safe copy the clicker file to a new folder and drag and drop there. 
- It will only extract embedded files.
