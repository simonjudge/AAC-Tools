========

**Aim**

- To collect the file paths and details of Symbol Systems used in vocab packages
- Originally designed to programmatically change a vocab package from one symbol system to another

**Usage:**

        SymbolCollector.py --imagedir="Path\To\Your\Image\Folder"  --symbolset=NameOfSymbolSet -database="SymbolCollector.db

- the DB is a sqllite database

**NB:**

- symbolset should be one word
- Browse the SymbolCollector.db to see what has already been done

**Plan:**

- Create a keywords tagged list of synonyms and alternatives of each symbol
